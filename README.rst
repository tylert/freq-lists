The data files here are a misguided attempt to try to facilitate proper
configuration of amateur radio transceivers and general-purpose receivers.
These files are already in a format that is easily imported into the radio
memory programming software called "CHIRP_".  The royalty-free and open-source
CHIRP_ software package is freely-available for Linux, Mac OS X and others and
is able to program many different amateur transceiver makes and models.

The following pre-built definition files are available for frequencies used by:

* Ottawa ARES a.k.a. `Emergency Measures Radio Group`_ (EMRG_)
* common 1200/9600 baud VHF packet frequencies (including ones for EMRG_)
* a few other VHF/UHF repeaters around Ottawa and Maidenhead grid square FN25
* common simplex choices for 2m (15/30 kHz spacing) and 70cm (12.5 kHz spacing)
* radio amateurs assisting the `Canadian Ski Marathon`_ (CSM_) [3]
* radio amateurs assisting the `Rideau Lakes Cycle Tour`_ (RLCT_)
* radio amateurs assisting the Rally of the `Tall Pines`_
* North American NOAA VHF weather broadcast information channels
* GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service) UHF channels
* marine ship/shore VHF channels
* ...

This information is intended purely for educational purposes.  It is your
responsibility to ensure that you and your equipment are behaving themselves
properly.
