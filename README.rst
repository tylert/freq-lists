The data files here are a misguided attempt to try to facilitate proper
configuration of amateur radio transceivers and general-purpose receivers.
These files are already in a format that is easily imported into the radio
memory programming software called "Chirp" [1].  The royalty-free and
open-source Chirp software package is freely-available for Linux, Mac OS X and
others and is able to program many different amateur transceiver makes and
models.  That software, along with these data files, may be used to quickly
program many mobiles and hand-held transceivers and reduce the need to perform
cumbersome and cryptic manual data entry.

The following pre-built definition files are available for frequencies used by:
- Ottawa ARES a.k.a. Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) [2]
- common 1200/9600 baud VHF packet frequencies (including ones for EMRG)
- a few other VHF/UHF repeaters around Ottawa and Maidenhead grid square FN25
- common simplex choices for 2m (15/30 kHz spacing) and 70cm (12.5 kHz spacing)
- radio amateurs assisting the Canadian Ski Marathon (CSM) [3]
- radio amateurs assisting the Rideau Lakes Cycle Tour (RLCT) [4]
- radio amateurs assisting the Rally of the Tall Pines [5]
- North American NOAA VHF weather broadcast information channels
- GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service) UHF channels
- marine ship/shore VHF channels
etc.

This information is intended purely for educational purposes.  It is your
responsibility to ensure that your equipment is behaving itself properly.
