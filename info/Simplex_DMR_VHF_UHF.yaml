# Common frequencies for DMR simplex
#   https://rac.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TwoMetre_Bandplan_ND2020TCA.pdf

# Wide band digital modes = greater than 3 kHz and less than 30 kHz wide
# Bandwidth is 12.5 kHz for DMR

# Old DMR pseudo-standard - https://va3xpr.net/dmr-simplex-frequencies

# May also be used for DSTAR, M17, NXDN, P25, YSF, etc.

# Wide band digital from 145.59 to 145.79 - 11 frequencies on a 20 kHz raster
# 145.51 used to be a recommended DMR simplex frequency in North America (145.79 too)
