# UHF GMRS and FRS simplex channels Canada/US and US-only duplex channels
# https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/FRS/GMRS_combined_channel_chart

# Designated GMRS-only and GMRS-hybrid frequencies use a +/-5 ppm frequency
# deviation while designated FRS-only frequencies use +/-2.5 ppm deviation.  A
# 25 kHz channel width translates to a +/-5 ppm frequency deviation.  A 12.5
# kHz channel width translates to a +/-2.5 ppm frequency deviation.
