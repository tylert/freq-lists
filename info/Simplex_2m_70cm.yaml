# Common simplex channels for FM and DMR (IARU Region 2)
# 144 to 148 MHz (primary) https://www.rac.ca/144-mhz-2m-page/
# 430 to 450 MHz (secondary) https://www.rac.ca/432-mhz-70-cm-page/
# wide band digital modes = greater than 3 kHz and less than 30 kHz wide
# bandwidth is 25 kHz for "normal" FM and 12.5 kHz for DMR
