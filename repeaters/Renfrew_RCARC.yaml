# *** "??? Net" Mondays at 19:30 Eastern on all linked repeaters ***

# VE3NRR VHF FM and VE3NRR UHF FM are linked
# VE3ZRR VHF FM and VE3NRR VHF/UHF FM are "permanently" linked
# VA3RBW VHF FM and VE3UCR VHF FM may be linked to VE3NRR VHF/UHF FM on-demand
# VE3NRR UHF FM is the hub and linked repeaters connect to it on 443.025+

# Apparently, all of these repeaters do not currently need CTCSS on their
# inputs.  However, there is talk that this might eventually change so we will
# continue to send them on the inputs to help ensure more folks have them
# programmed into their radios.  It should be "safe" to send the tone even
# though no tone is required for access.

# All these repeaters have CTCSS on output with a slight proviso for VE3NRR VHF
# FM (maybe VE3NRR UHF FM too???)... CTCSS will be sent "only when COS is
# present... for the operation of IRLP" (which means it will be present only if
# the traffic originates on IRLP but not if the traffic originates from the
# repeater input???).  But, that too is expected to change sometime as well.
# When this happens, there might be 2 different tones:  one for IRLP and one
# for regular use.  This might mean there will eventually be 2 channel configs
# for VE3NRR VHF FM.
